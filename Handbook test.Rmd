# **1. Introduction**

## **1.1 Quantiative data user interface**
Welcome to the quantitative data (qData) user interface (UI). This "handbook" is designed to guide users through the process of uploading qData from toxicity experiments into the NIVA Risk Assessment Database (RAdb). The RAdb serves as a data repository and FAIRification hub for exposure, hazard and risk assessment data, and are collectively modules of the Source To Outcome Predictor. 
This UI aims to streamline data submission, ensuring that the submitted information is accurate, consistent, and readily accessible for subsequent analysis. This handbook provides comprehensive instructions on how to navigate the UI, upload data, and troubleshoot common issues. It is an essential resource for users contributing data to RAdb or that want to make data more FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and reuseable) in other applications.
Whether you are an experienced user or new to the system, this handbook will help you understand the steps required to efficiently import your data, the significance of each input, and the best practices for ensuring that your submissions meet the required standards by RAdb. We encourage you to use this guide as a reference whenever you interact with the UI, ensuring that the data you provide can be effectively utilized for hazard assessment purposes.

## **1.2 NIVA Risk Assessment Database (RAdb) and the Source to Outcome Predictor (STOPredictor)**
The NIVA Risk Assessment Database (NIVA RAdb) is a module-based tool developed by the Norwegian Institute for Water Research (NIVA) to streamline and enhance the process of capturing exposure, hazard and risk assessment-relevant data. This database is informed by principles outlined for the Aggregate Exposure Pathway (AEP) and Adverse Outcome Pathway (AOP) frameworks to compile, integrate, and visualize data across various environmental exposure pathways (rotes) and biological organization levels for chemical and non-chemical stressors. It offers several key features:
1)	Integration of Data: RAdb compiles exposure and effect data from various biological levels, utilizing frameworks like Aggregate Exposure Pathways (AEP) and Adverse Outcome Pathways (AOP) to organise information consistent with principles of the Source To Outcome Pathway (STOP).
2)	Risk Identification: The database and STOPredictor aids in identifying toxic endpoints, susceptible species, and risks across multiple environmental contexts.
3)	Data Visualization: RAdb and the associated user interface (STOPredictor) provides visualization tools to interpret complex data, making it easier to analyse and report findings.
This database is instrumental in enhancing the quality and reliability of environmental risk assessments by offering a structured, scientific approach to data management and analysis.
